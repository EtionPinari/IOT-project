# IOT-project
# Made public only as of 24-July-2021
# We designed and implemented a software prototype for a social distancing application, which after continous proximity to other people sends a notification to the phones.
# This project uses 'TinyOS' to create the IOT nodes and their payloads, requires Cooja to simulate (or any similar program) and finally uses
# Node-Red and IFTTT to communicate with phones.
