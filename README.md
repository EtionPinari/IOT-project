# IOT-project
# Made public as of 24-July-2021
 We designed and implemented a software prototype for a social distancing application, which after continous proximity to other people sends a notification to the phones.
 This project uses 'TinyOS' to create the IOT nodes and their payloads, requires Cooja to simulate (or any similar program) and finally uses
 Node-Red and IFTTT to communicate with phones.
 To import the project, 
 
   1- Import to TinyOs the 3 files named Project and build it.
   2- Go to the folder Nodered and import to Node-Red the file inside it.
   3- Connect your phone to IFTTT
